CANSAT RELEASE PROJECT BASED ON GUI MODEL USING TKINTER IN PYTHON

This project is a CANSAT release system implemented using a GUI model in Python with the help of the Tkinter library. The system monitors various states and performs actions based on different conditions during the CANSAT's ascent and descent phases. It provides real-time information about altitude, time elapsed, air pressure, and temperature.

-----------------------------------
Dependencies
Python 3.9.7
Tkinter library
PIL library (for image handling)

-----------------------------------
Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Ensure that you have Python 3.9.7 or a compatible version installed.
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install pillow
Run the application:
python main.py

-----------------------------------
Features
GUI-based system for monitoring and controlling CANSAT release.
Real-time display of altitude, time elapsed, air pressure, and temperature.
State tracking for system calibration, receiving commands, rocket rising, data collection, payload release, camera activation, and more.
Visual indicators for different states and actions.
Option to activate/deactivate the camera and buzzer.
Automated actions based on predefined conditions.
Responsive user interface with image backgrounds.

-----------------------------------
Usage
Launch the application by running the main.py file.
Click on the "<<<LAUNCH>>>" button to open a new window.
The new window displays real-time information and updates on the CANSAT's altitude, time elapsed, and various states.
The GUI system automatically performs actions based on the tracked states and conditions.
Monitor the different states and actions through the displayed information on the window.

-----------------------------------
Project Structure
main.py: Contains the main code for initializing the GUI and handling the button click event.
kalpana.png: Background image used in the GUI.
README.md: Documentation file.
